## **Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Bikeshare Project**
This repo hosts my Bikeshare project files for the Udacity nanodegree, [Programming for Data Science with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).  The `bikeshare_project.py` Python script filters and summarizes bike share data for one of three user-chosen cities - Chicago, New York City, or Washington.  The user is then prompted to filter the data by one or all months and/or one or all days of the week.  Statistics are computed and displayed for most common times of travel, start and end statitions and trips, trip durations, and users characteristics.

### Files
- `bikeshare_project.py`
- data files:
    - `chicago.csv`
    - `new_york_city.csv`
    - `washington.csv`

### Usage 
Run `python bikeshare_project.py` from the same directory where the data files are located.

### Credits
_All work is solely my own._  I used the external website [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for help converting seconds into human-readable time, displaying all columns of a pandas dataframe, and formatting integers with commas.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) pages consulted:
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/775049/how-do-i-convert-seconds-to-hours-minutes-and-seconds
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11361985/output-data-from-all-columns-in-a-dataframe-in-pandas
